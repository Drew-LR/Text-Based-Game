Draughty halls and dusty rooms. Heroes dine with kings and live in luxury under the auspices of our fame. But the people's need for heroes endures beyond the rigour of our youth. New challenges arise and are met. A new generation of celebrants and celebrities. Those of us who outlive our glory days live here... or worse, must wander, as Aidan did.#

You take your trusty old questing journal from the bookshelf and brush away the dust from its familiar leather-bound cover. It has been some time since your last quest, maybe brushing up on your old notes is a wise choice.#

Notes on how to store and organise everything you need for a successful adventre...#
Best any foe with these hard, fast rules on fighting...#
Time to close this old book, and open a new one...# 


The Inventory - Press 'i' to open your inventory, it is available at almost any time except, for instance, during battle. The inventory is where you store weapons, shields and items. Use the 'up' and 'down' arrows to select one of these catagories.  Once selected you can view the list of your current items on the right. selecting the number of an item will highlight it, this way you may view the item's description and stats. Press enter to equip an item, this change is visible in the corresponding category above. Attempting to epuip the same item twice will unequip it.#

#

Battling - When a battle begins your equipment will dictate which actions you can make. 'Attack' with your equipped weapon to deal damage, the better the weapon the higher damage. 'Defend' with you shield to halve damage from incoming attacks, this always goes first, an equipped shield also offers a passive defence bonus. 'Use' your equipped items, their effects vary so always check thier description in your inventory. Some items do not provide action options, but instead provide passive bonuses both in and out of battle.#

Be aware of you and your opponents 'speed'. Whoever has the highest speed at the start of a turn has the initiative to go first, and in addition has the change to deal 'critical' damage when attacking. But don't worry, defending, or using defensive items raises your speed allowing you to take the initiative. However, attacking and offensive items lower your speed. This is of course true of the enemy as well. If your opponent becomes too much faster than yourself, you may lose the opportunity to act that turn.#

Navigation is a fundamental tenet of all woodsmen and travelers. These winding stone paths are no different to the trails of the wild. The library is around the corner on the left...surely.#
#
1) Turn left.#
2) Procede forward.#
3) Turn right.#
@
This time for sure...#
Or was this way?...#
#


Another alley, a fine place for an ambush.#
#
1) Keep moving forward.#
2) Go back.#
@
Hopefully there's nobody unsavoury waiting at the other end...#
Or now sneaking up behind you...#


A fork in the road, neither path seems optimal.#
#
1) Left.#
2) Right.#
@
Perhaps the library was on the left after all, unless you got turned around...#
The way right seems marginally less dank though...#


This part of the city wall looks ready to give way. Best to hasten your step.#
#
1) Hurry on.#

Even ruffians wouldn't tally here...#
