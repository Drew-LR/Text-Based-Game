The ageing blonde hero placed a coin pouch and a folded note on the smoking table next to your armchair. he extended his hand, palm up, in a gensture of offer. You assume accepting the gold is a condition of accepting whatever the contents of the note may require from you. do you accept the offer?#

1) Accept.#

To your rooms you go...#
A drink, a momentary solace...#
A stock of potions is wise for an adventurer...#
A shield against the reaper, and a weapon to push him back...#

Draughty halls and dusty rooms. Heroes dine with kings and live in luxury under the auspices of our fame. But the people's need for heroes endures beyond the rigour of our youth. New challenges arise and are met. A new generation of celebrants and celebrities. Those of us who outlive our glory days live here... or worse, must wander, as Aidan did.#

You take your trusty old questing journal from the bookshelf and brush away the dust from its familiar leather-bound cover. It has been some time since your last quest, maybe brushing up on your old notes is a wise choice.#

Notes on how to store and organise everything you need for a successful adventre...#
Best any foe with these hard, fast rules on fighting...#
Time to close this old book, and open a new one...# 


The Inventory - Press 'i' to open your inventory, it is available at almost any time except, for instance, during battle. The inventory is where you store weapons, shields and items. Use the 'up' and 'down' arrows to select one of these catagories.  Once selected you can view the list of your current items on the right. selecting the number of an item will highlight it, this way you may view the item's description and stats. Press enter to equip an item, this change is visible in the corresponding category above. Attempting to epuip the same item twice will unequip it.#

#

Battling - When a battle begins your equipment will dictate which actions you can make. 'Attack' with your equipped weapon to deal damage, the better the weapon the higher damage. 'Defend' with you shield to halve damage from incoming attacks, this always goes first, an equipped shield also offers a passive defence bonus. 'Use' your equipped items, their effects vary so always check thier description in your inventory. Some items do not provide action options, but instead provide passive bonuses both in and out of battle.#

Be aware of you and your opponents 'speed'. Whoever has the highest speed at the start of a turn has the initiative to go first, and in addition has the change to deal 'critical' damage when attacking. But don't worry, defending, or using defensive items raises your speed allowing you to take the initiative. However, attacking and offensive items lower your speed. This is of course true of the enemy as well. If your opponent becomes too much faster than yourself, you may lose the opportunity to act that turn.#

You understand the need for an old man to take his nap. But needs must, and the librarian's dreams stand between you and the swift completion of your own work, and by extension your own nap as well.#
#
1) Wake the librarian.#
2) Wait.#
@
Maybe pretend to drop a book by accident...#
Explore the library untill he wakes of his own accord...#


He seems not to gather the importance a quest. Fairytales are based off the great deeds of our forebears, not the other way around! Though to be fair there are those whose tales tend to be too tall.#
#
1) Question the librarian further.#
2) Explore the library yourself.#
3) Leave the library.#
@
Impress upon him how serious questing is!...#
With so many old books there must be something worth learning, surely...#
If the man who gave you the note is really supposed to be the hero from the book, then perhaps it is a fairytale afterall...#


"The only things worth looking at here are the maps," the librarian drones tiredly, "because if you've come to this part of town, you're lost." You try several times to communicate with him but he just keeps repeating the line about maps, like he's stuck in a loop. Old age is more cruel to some than others.#
#
1) Explore the library yourself.#
2) Leave the library.#
@
maybe do have a look at those maps...#

Arriving at the library you are struck by the grandure of the detailed stone facade. Most of the buildings in Old Town were like this. The work of skilled masons expressing their pride for king and country. Unfortunately fallen, now, into disrepair.#
#
1) Enter the library.#
2) Make your way back to the tavern.#

"The old kingdom didn't decide who could come and go. Or force one to be registered with a guild just to take a job, and then demand a spate of fees and taxes for the privilege. In those good old days a man could slay a goblin and receive gold, lodging and praise in return. Then be on his way. Today, you could save a damsel's life and the Guards would track you down fine you for waving a sword. The real irony is that not a single one of those pompus brats would know what to do with one."...#
