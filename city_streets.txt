Navigation is a fundamental tenet of all woodsmen and travelers. These winding stone paths are no different to the trails of the wild. The library is around the corner on the left...surely.#
#
1) Turn left.#
2) Procede forward.#
3) Turn right.#

This time for sure...#
Or was this way?...#

Another alley, a fine place for an ambush.#
#
1) Keep moving forward.#
2) Go back.#

Hopefully there's nobody unsavoury waiting at the other end...#
Or now sneaking up behind you...#


A fork in the road, neither path seems optimal.#
#
1) Left.#
2) Right.#

Perhaps the library was on the left after all, unless you got turned around...#
The way right seems marginally less dank though...#
