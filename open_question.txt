 Arriving at the library you are greeted by a closed door.#
 #
1) Open it like a normal person#
2) Open it like Ernest Hemingway#  
@
 It seems to have worked, you pass through the door in the most mundane way imaginable...#
 You ram the door forcefully with your head! It flys open dramatically and you swagger through it, looking for any bottles which may happen to be sequestered within...#


 This is the ultimate test of the open question feature! it has four posibilities, each of which does something. Choose...#
#
1) Add HP#
2) Subtract HP#
3) Add Gold#
4) Subtract Gold#
@
 You now have more HP#
 You now have less HP, why did you choose that?#
 Gold has been added#
 Thanks for the Gold, stranger#
