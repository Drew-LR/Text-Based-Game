 The fire crackles gently as you doze in your usual armchair at the tavern. This is the Retired Adventurers Arms, a resting place for heroes both famous and forgotten. Perhaps not as lively as the city's other watering holes, where rambunctious young travelers drink, jostle and sing about their most recent deeds obtaining wealth and glory. Nevertheless, the Retired Adventurers Arms was a place steeped in the storytelling of great deeds, albeit ones from times gone by...


The short figure of man a moves towards the fire, it's the blonde one whose name you don't recall. Usually a hero's retirement is spent boasting of his mastery with an aray of weapons. His cunning in solving puzzles and avoiding traps. Or that time he saved the princess and the entire kingdom. But this hero, if he was that, shared no stories. In fact he never spoke at all...


His eyes light up at the prospect of your support in the matter, whatever that turns out to be. The note becomes unignorably conspicuous as you lift the coin purse and count the contents thereof. Your slight companion could never have been the physically imposing type. Especially so now, in his twilight years. Yet something in his ardent blue-eyed gaze compels you to make good on your promise. Not out of fear, but something else. As comical and harmless as this tiny, pointy-eared specimen of a might-have-been-hero seemed, he had the ineffible quality of being the most reliable man you had every met. someone who could indeed be trusted to save a princess, or a kingdom, or both. Perhaps he has stories to tell after all...


He goes away quielty, taking his purse and note with him, and is quickly obscured by the pipe smoke hanging in the room. You reconsider your nap and doze off into an early bad ending. Good one.
